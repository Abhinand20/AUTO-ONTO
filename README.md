# AUTO-ONTO
AUTO-ONTO is a one-stop solution to extract an ontology from text corpus spanning across vast domains. It uses lightweight Natural Languate Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, and is easily deployable, scalable and feasible on any cloud platform. AUTO-ONTO is a hackathon 1st place solution and due to confidentiality reasons some part of the code has been revoked. Other than that, feel free to use it to extract heirarchical relationships from any dataset.

The file autonto.py has all the algorithm code and the Autonto_main.ipynb has the main code to run the model on a dataset. Some sample outputs are present in the output directory.

## Below is the approach we propose in our solution for generating ontologies-
